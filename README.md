## Project Overview
I created a procedural jellyfish using Houdini.

## Veins <br>
Made use of the 'Find Shortest Path' node in Houdini to create vein-like objects for my jellyfish bell.

## Houdini FAQ
[File Cache Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00s9YWDWFs0) - How do I use the File Cache node? Where does it save and how do versions work?

[Simulation Caching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwIuzB9FkX0) - Why is my timeline turning blue/orange? Why isn't my simulation updating even though I made changes?

## (Optional) Extra Credit
- Add another part to your jellyfish. This can be something real (ex: crown jellyfish and lions mane jellyfish have some pretty crazy features that might be fun to recreate) or whatever zany alien jellyfish addition you can imagine!
- Refine one of the existing parts (ex: adding scalloped edges and dents/puckering to the bell of the jellyfish)
- Render your jellyfish (a good place to start is watching [part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ph-7ZpN5oY) and [part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQPDf-bupY) of Entagma's Houdini in 5 Minutes series where they briefly cover rendering basics
- Add some flair to your scene by adding a background (ex: coral or rock formations)
## Submission
- Fork this repository
- Update your README
    - Please delete the assignment README text
    - A description of your project
    - A video of your animated jellyfish ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXtDd1lPDmc) of how to save a video of your viewport out of Houdini)
- Create a pull request to this repository
- Submit your Houdini file to Canvas along with a link to your pull request
(Don't upload your houdini files to github -- it's a pain to upload big/binary files. Just canvas is fine!)
